<h2>Chapter Three - The Big Chance</h2>

<p>
Two weeks had past, Alan had been training hard with the senior team when the manager called him asside to tell him he was impressed 
with how he had been training and that he would be involved in the upcoming match day squad with the senior team. Alan was so excited 
with the news, he couldn't believe it, he called his family and friends to let them know of the great news. He was going to be in the 
first team squad for a home game, which meant there was a possibility he could  play at Old Trafford, 'The Theatre of Dreams' as it is 
known. He had been there many times before with his dad to see the team play, never thinking he would be sitting amongst the players one 
day. Alan invited his family and friends over for the day to see him, all paid for by the club.
<br>
The morning of the big game, he met with his family and friends at the stadium and gave them a quick tour of the stadium and players 
lounge where they got to meet some other players. A member of staff showed them to their seats. Alan had to meet up with the team for 
the pre-match training. He walked into the changing room where the senior team players had begun to arrive. None of this felt real to him,
it was all happening so quick. The senior players greeted him and said well done on getting there and if he gets a chance today to take it,
to  show the manager and fans what he can do. The manager arrived after all the players ans staff were in the room and proceeded to name 
the team sheet for the match. Alan was surprised and shocked to hear his name called out as part of the starting eleven. Some of the other 
congratulated him. His dreams had come through!!
<br>
The players entered the pitch for the first time that day for the pre match warm up, Alan was in awe at the size of the stadium and the 
fans chanting and singing with over an hour left until kick-off. One of the senior players approached him and told him to use  the 
atmosphere as fuel to drive him on. Finally, kick-off had arrived, the atmosphere was electric. The game started and Alan had the game 
of his life scoring a goal and setting up another in a 2-1 win. He was substituted with ten minutes to go to a standing ovation from the 
crowd while they chanted his name. Alan had made a huge impression. The manager congratulated him as he left the field. This was it, the 
start of Alan's senior career had arrived, there was no looking back now. He had made it.
