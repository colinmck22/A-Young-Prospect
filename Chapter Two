<h2>Chapter Two - A Youth at the Biggest Club in the World</h2>

<p>
Alan' first day at his new club had finally arrived, he arrived early for his first training session as he was so excited.
    He was greated by a club rep and brought into the changing rooms with the current and new youth players for the start of the season.
    The coach told them they would start the training session by watching the senior players train to show how hard to have to work if
    you want to succeed at the very top.
    <br>
    Following the senior training, the young players got to meet their hero's. They talked with each other gaining some advice from some of the best
    players in the world. Told to work had, ignore the media and public attention surrounding the club and not to let it distract them from becoming the best.
    Following the talk, the youth team were put through their paces on the training ground.
    <br>
    Weeks past, Alan was progressing well and had been improving his game a lot. The coach approached him and said he would be bringing him up a level to the U23's
    training to see how he managed against the bigger and better players. Alan couldn't believe how fast he had started progressing at the club he has
    followed his whole life, his dreams were starting to come trough. He was training with some senior players and young players that had already made
    their senior appearances for the club. It was like a dream. Some of the senior players and members of the coaching staff and spoke to him and
    told him to keep up the good work, that he had been impressing them. This delighted Alan.
