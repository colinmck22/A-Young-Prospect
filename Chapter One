<h2>Chapter One â€“ The Trial</h2>
<p>
    A young footballer <strong>Alan Davis</strong> was spotted by a football scout while playing for his local football team,
    Tullamore Town FC. The scout was from the world-renownd football team, <strong>Manchester United</strong>.
    Following the game, the scout approached Alan and offered him a trial with Manchesster United in the coming weeks.
    Alan had been eagerly anticipating the trial, training hard every day to ensure he was prepared. The big day had finally arrived and
    Alan was up at the first sign of sunlight. He barely slept a wink from all the excitement. He had his breakfast and headed off for
    manchester with his dad. On arrival at the training ground he met with a lot of other young players that had been selected for the trial.
    <br>
    They were directed into changing rooms by a member of staff at the training ground and told to be ready and on the training field in 20 minutes.
    Alan could sense the nervousness in the room as not one person was talking to another. It showed on their faces.
    A tall man with broad shoulders and dark hair entered the room and looked around at the players and all he said was "I hope ye  are ready!",
    then left the room. Nervous, the players made their way to the field where there was a team of coaches waiting for their arrival.
    They were told there would be a training session followed by a match to try impress the manager.
