<h1>A Young Prospect</h1>
<h2>Chapter One â€“ The Trial</h2>
<p>
    A young footballer <strong>Alan Davis</strong> was spotted by a football scout while playing for his local football team,
    Tullamore Town FC The scout was from the well-known football team <strong>Manchester United</strong>.
    The scout approached Alan and offered him a trial with Manchesster United in the coming weeks.
    The big day arrived and Alan was awake early with excitement.
    His dad brought him to the training ground for his trial where he met with a lot of other young prospects that had been selected for the trial.
    They were all brought into the changing room by a member of staff at the training ground.
    A tall man with broad shoulders and dark hair entered and told them to be on the field in 20 minutes.
    Nervous, the players all made their way to the training ground where there was a team of coaches waiting for them to arrive.
    They were told a training session would happen followed by a match to show the manager what they could do.
    Alan had a great game and scored two goals, leaving him full of confidence and eager to hear what the manager and coaches had to say after the match.
    The players were told to shower and return to the pitch where they would find out their fate.
    Upon returning from the sower, Alan, extremely nervous but also very confident after how he performed got the great news
    that he would be one of five players to be selected and given a youth contract with the club.
