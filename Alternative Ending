<h2>Chapter Three - Alternative Ending- The Loan Move</h2>

<p>
Alan had been training with the senior team for a few weeks, improving his game both mentally and physically both on and off the pitch.
He was learning so much from training with and being around the senior players at the club. He was loving life at the club he grew up 
following. He was playing with players he idolized and even still had posters of some of them on his bedroom wall. One day after training,
the manager approached him and told him he had been training very well and that had a bright future at the club if he kept working hard. 
He told him he would be involved in a match day squad in the coming weeks. When Alan was selected for the squad there were a few injuries 
to some of the senior players and the fixture list was also very busy with many gaems coming thick and thin so Alan knew the manager 
would be rotating players to give some of them a rest. He knew a chance would come his way sooner or later.
<br><br>
Finally the day arrived when Alan was included in the squad, he was so excited about his first time to be involved. He barely slept all 
night, day dreaming of playing at Old Trafford. When he arrived at the stadium, a few hours before kick-off, the atmosphere around the 
grounds was already building. Thousands of fans had already arrived and the crows were gathering. This brought back memories of when Alan 
was there with his dad as a fan. He was greeted at the players entrance by a member of staff and shown to the players lounge for a pre-match 
meal and then to the changing rooms with the players. The manager entered and began to name the team sheet for the day. Alan was among 
the substitutes for the day. He didn't show his disappointment at not being selected but kept his head up and knew he still might get a 
chance from the substitutes bench. The 90 minutes passed and Alan was not used during the game. He was very disappointed.
<br><br>
After the game, the manager approached Alan and told him that the club had decided that he wasn't going to get as much game time as he 
needed so they would be sending him out on loan to a team in the Championship, the league below. Newcastle United had been watching him 
and they wanted him on loan for the rest of the season. Alan was rocked by the news but knew many of the clubs best players in the history 
of the club had done this as part of their development and it is known to be a big part of the clubs tradition over the years. Knowing 
this, and the encouraging words from the manager, Alan felt confident he could show his ability elsewhere. The manager told him it was 
all part of the developement process and to work as hard there as he had been here, that he would be keeping a close eye on him.
<br><br>
The next day Alan packed his things and went off to Newcastle to meet his new team mates, some were friendly and welcoming, others not so 
much. The facilities were nothing compared to Manchester and it made him realise how good he had it in Manchester and not to take it for 
granted, his development had already begun....
