<h2>Chapter Three - Alternative Ending- The Loan Move</h2>

<p>
Alan had been training with the senior team for a few weeks, improving his game both mentally and physically both on and off the pitch.
He was learning so much from training with and being around the senior players at the club. He was loving life at the club he grew up 
following. He was playing with players he idolized and even still had posters of some of them on his bedroom wall. One day after training,
the manager approached him and told him he had been training very well and that had a bright future at the club if he kept working hard. 
He told him he would be involved in a match day squad in the coming weeks. When Alan was selected for the squad there were a few injuries 
to some of the senior players and the fixture list was also very busy with many gaems coming thick and thin so Alan knew the manager 
would be rotating players to give some of them a rest. He knew a chance would come his way sooner or later.
<br><br>
Finally the big day arrived, Alan was so excited about the big game. He was up all night dreaming of playing at Old Trafford, he barely 
slept a wink. When he arrived a few hours before kick-off, the atmosphere around the stadium was already building. Many fans had already 
arrived and the crows were gathering. This brought back memories of when he was there with his dad as part of the crowd. He was greeted at 
the players entrance by a member of staff and shown to the players lounge for a meal then to the changing rooms with the players. The
manager entered and began to name the team sheet for the day. Alan was among the substitutes for the day. He didn't show his disappointment 
at not starting the game but kept his head down and knew he still might get a chance. The 90 minutes passed and Alan was not used during 
the game. He was very disappointed.
<br><br>
After the game, the manager approached Alan and that the club had decided to send him out on loan to a team in the league below. Newcastle 
United wanted him. Alan was rocked by the news but knew many of the clubs best players had done this as part of their development and it 
was part of the clubs tradition to loan out players so he didn't let it bother him too much. The manager told him it was all part of the 
developement process and to work as hard there as he had been here, that he would be keeping a close eye on him.
<br><br>
The next day Alan packed his things and went off to Newcastle to meet his new team mates, some were friendly and welcoming, others not so 
much. The facilities were nothing compared to Manchester and it made him realise how good he had it in Manchester and not to take it for 
granted, his development had already begun....
